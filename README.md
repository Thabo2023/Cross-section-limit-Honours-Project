**Year:** 2022

#### Aim
The project aims to detect dark matter indirectly by predicting gamma-ray signals resulting from dark matter annihilation. These signals can help determine characteristics of dark matter, such as cross-sections and mass.

#### Methodology
1. **Target Selection:** Focus on simple targets like the Coma galaxy cluster.
2. **Data Comparison:** Compare observed dark matter emissions with known gamma-ray data to place limits on dark matter properties.
3. **Analysis:** Use the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile to model dark matter density and compute the J-factor to estimate gamma-ray flux.

#### Key Findings
- **J-Factor Calculation:** Found to be ≈ 1.03 × 10^16 GeV^2/cm^5, indicating a strong gamma-ray signal.
- **Exclusion of Cross-Sections:** Values above the thermal relic cross-section were excluded, providing constraints on dark matter properties.
- **Confidence Levels:** Determined confidence levels at which certain dark matter models are excluded.

#### Conclusions
The project successfully excluded dark matter models with cross-sections higher than the thermal relic cross-section and established confidence levels for these exclusions. This helps narrow down potential characteristics of dark matter.

#### Implications
The findings contribute to the development of models for dark matter detection and improve the understanding of its properties, aiding future research in this domain.
